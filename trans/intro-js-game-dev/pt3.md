构建游戏

Building the Game We’ve defined our main game objects and set them floating in space. Now we need to add the game logic. In the case of our Asteroids clone, we need to enable the ship to take damage when it collides with asteroids and to accrue score when it destroys asteroids. We’ll also enable the player to shoot asteroids somehow and implement a “game over” state and game levels. Before we get into the gameplay aspects, we’ll also find out how to accept user interaction so the ship can be controlled.
